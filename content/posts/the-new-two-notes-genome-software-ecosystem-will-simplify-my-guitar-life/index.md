In 2016, I wrote about using [Two Notes products and a Reactive Load box to get great sound at low volume]({{< ref "how-to-get-a-great-guitar-tone-at-any-volume" >}}). Since then, I've been on a massive journey of discovery and finding what works for me and what doesn't.

Back then I couldn't get a great sound out of the Two Notes C.A.B. and the Two Notes Impulse Responses that I was using, so I resorted to using regular IRs.

Two Notes developed a special, proprietary technology called 'DynIR' (Dynamic Impulse Response) that allows users to choose a microphone and position it anywhere along a 3D axis, in reference to the centre of a speaker in a virtual cabinet. The user is aided by a visually helpful UI that perfectly mimics a studio environment and allows that virtual positioning of microphones, as you would in the real world.

I don't confess to know how their technology works, but I presume that movement of the mic selects a different IR for the user. An IR (Impulse Response) is just an acoustic sound response captured in a small WAV file.

> An **impulse response** is the reaction of any dynamic system [in this case a speaker cabinet] in response to some external change [an amplifier signal]. — [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response)
