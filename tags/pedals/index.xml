Tuesday 22 March 2022 marked the official announcement of the Line 6 DL4 MkII. We heard a few murmerings a fortnight ago when a leaked image of a two page magazine spread showcased the new pedal and ever since, there has been intense speculation across various websites about the feature-set of the updated classic.

Attempting to swerve a cripling and unforgiving pandemic that would ultimately go on to cost so many lives and caused tremendous sadness and grief. It still is, to this day.
