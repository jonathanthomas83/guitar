I can now document my year long journey from Axe FX newbie to massive digital convert.
Big investment I had to sell a lot of my old analog gear, including my amp and pedals, to get back some of the money I spent on the Axe FX II XL. It was a huge make or break investment of time, money and loss; of things I’d come to cherish.</description></item><item><title>Building my dream guitar rig. 2017: Fractal Axe FX II XL</title><link>https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/building-my-dream-guitar-rig-2017-fractal-axe-fx-ii-xl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2017 00:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/building-my-dream-guitar-rig-2017-fractal-axe-fx-ii-xl/</guid><description>Sometimes, you just need to accept the facts.
[Disclaimer: this is an old article and explains my thoughts about the Fractal Axe FX II XL in 2017]
So, after finally coming to a place where I could accept that I had most of the basic tones covered, why did I still want more? Why was I still missing my Mesa? Why did I suddenly feel the urge to buy a Plexi style amplifier?</description></item><item><title>Reactive load and Impulse Response (IR) speaker cabinet simulation question and answer</title><link>https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/reactive-load-and-impulse-response-speaker-cabinet-simulation-question-and-answer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/reactive-load-and-impulse-response-speaker-cabinet-simulation-question-and-answer/</guid><description>I had a lot of questions after my first blog post — “How to get a great guitar tone at any volume”. Here’s a few and I’ll add more over time. Feel free to ask more questions in the comments.
What if I have an amp/speaker combo, not just an amplifier head? You can still use a reactive load box with it.

It’s always been a passion of mine to be able to hear what my guitar sounds like in stereo. I bought my first stereo effects pedal, a DOD FX747 Supersonic Flanger way back in 2000.
