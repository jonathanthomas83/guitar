The Kemper had killed my “GAS” for amplifiers successfully for the last 12 months or so, but recently, my passion for amps has bitten me, with a vengeance.
I had a brief flirt with amps back in January 2019, but it didn’t amount to much as ultimately, the amp in question didn’t quite live up to my expectations and the Kemper trumped it in terms of versatility.</description></item><item><title>Kemper owner for a year and why I’m returning to valves in 2019</title><link>https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/kemper-owner-for-a-year-and-why-im-returning-to-valves-in-2019/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/kemper-owner-for-a-year-and-why-im-returning-to-valves-in-2019/</guid><description>The paralysing limitations of having access to every guitar amplifier in the world.
I admit, the last few months have been a bit of a struggle with the Kemper. Not because it sounds anything less than superb, but simply because the profiles aren’t versatile enough once I’ve found &amp;lsquo;the one’.
Once I’ve settled on a profile, I’m stuck with it because no other profile comes close. That makes me feel a little uneasy as I’d like to feel a bit more freedom than that.</description></item><item><title>Reactive load and Impulse Response (IR) speaker cabinet simulation question and answer</title><link>https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/reactive-load-and-impulse-response-speaker-cabinet-simulation-question-and-answer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/reactive-load-and-impulse-response-speaker-cabinet-simulation-question-and-answer/</guid><description>I had a lot of questions after my first blog post — “How to get a great guitar tone at any volume”. Here’s a few and I’ll add more over time. Feel free to ask more questions in the comments.
What if I have an amp/speaker combo, not just an amplifier head? You can still use a reactive load box with it. Unplug the internal speaker and go straight into the load box.</description></item><item><title>How to get a great guitar tone at any volume</title><link>https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/how-to-get-a-great-guitar-tone-at-any-volume/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2017 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/how-to-get-a-great-guitar-tone-at-any-volume/</guid><description>Stereo with one amp, wet/dry, no microphones, any speaker you can think of, consistent beautiful tone, low volume…a guitarists dream!
It’s always been a passion of mine to be able to hear what my guitar sounds like in stereo. I bought my first stereo effects pedal, a DOD FX747 Supersonic Flanger way back in 2000. Since then, I’ve been on a mission to find a good stereo solution that wouldn’t involve two separate amps.</description></item></channel></rss>
