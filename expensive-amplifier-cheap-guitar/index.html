I did however, identify sounds and tones with particular amps.\n Fender amps gave me a very crisp and clear, clean tone. Marshall amps gave me a dirty and full on crunch and Mesa Boogie amps could get metal. Primitive and narrow minded? Maybe. But 20+ years on, I now know that this isn’t too far from the truth.\nSo all this lead to an obsession with guitar amplifiers in my late teens and early twenties. The kind of obsession that kept me up all night.\nI’d be thinking about Mesa Rectifier’s and Fender DeVille’s, how I could utilise both to get two extremes. How I could utilise four to do stereo!

Traynor YCV80 80w Tube Amp — for some reason, the guy at the music shop convinced me that it’d be a great Fender substitute. Fender The Twin Amp — bloody awful — and definitely not the same as what we all know as a ‘Fender Twin’. Mesa Single Rectifier Mesa Dual Rectifier Laney Lionheart 5w Combo  Not cheap and certainly not your ‘run of the mill’ amps. The Mesa’s were huge and they were great fun to play around with. The Lionheart became one of my favourite amps, ever.\n I’ll be controversial and will say that most of the tone comes from the amplifier, not the guitar.\n Over the years, I’ve switched out the amps for digital alternatives, and that’s something I never thought I’d do…so I’ve obviously let my standards change (carefully trying to not say “slip”) over the years. But I’ve come to learn that guitars are vital and quality isn’t something you should underestimate with regard to the actual instrument itself.\nIn fact, I could possibly have changed my whole view on this…Keep a look out for “Expensive guitar, cheap amp…”!\nWhat do you think…expensive amp or expensive guitar?\n","wordCount":"531","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/expensive-amplifier-cheap-guitar/sitting-on-an-amp.jpeg","datePublished":"2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/expensive-amplifier-cheap-guitar/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Guitar","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://jonathanthomas83.github.io/guitar/ accesskey=h title="Guitar (Alt + H)">Guitar</a>
