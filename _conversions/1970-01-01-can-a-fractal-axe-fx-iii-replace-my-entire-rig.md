In September 2020, [I had to sell my entire rig](__GHOST_URL__/built-my-dream-guitar-rig-part-6-but-i-lost-it-all/) and was left with only a guitar. 

When I saw all my amps and pedals disappear, there was a mixture of emotions from *"I'll never be able to replace these expensive things"* to *"I kind of want to try something a bit more compact and simpler"*. In December, I had the opportunity to purchase a second hand Fractal Axe FX III and in truth, it was exactly the unit I had in mind to fill the void left behind by my beloved amps and pedals.

My first dabble with the Axe FX III didn't last long, I couldn't get it do sound right. That could have been a number of things from dodgy unit to my ineptitude. But the fact is, I couldn't get it to match my Kemper at the time, let alone sound better than it. 

That said I had the Axe FX II XL for a long time and I absolutely loved it. So, it's fair to say that I had a fair amount of experience with the Fractal units and that I owed it to the Axe FX III to give it another shot.

### In action

First time I plugged in to my newly aqcuired Axe FX III, I realised that I must have been doing something fundamentally wrong because this one sounded superb straight out of the box. 

This is something that I'd heard people say but never experienced it myself. I did a full factory reset and they were correct, my simple patch and it sounded glorious. 

### My typical signal chain

amp > delay / reverb

Aligning IRs

Could never settle on the sound and doubted myself and my abilities
